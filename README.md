# SIC-Based_Slotted-ALOHA

## Highlights
This repository provides MATLAB codes for simulating and analyzing SIC-Based Slotted ALOHA with Multi-Antenna Reception. The scripts include both analytical and simulation-based evaluations of system throughput, optimization of the code rate, and visualization tools for performance comparison.

## A quick Demo
Please run the ```simulation/Sim_2user_Multi_anntenna_SA_MG.m```, ```simulation/Sim_MultiAnt_OptR.m```,  ```analysis/optimization.m``` and ```analysis/Ana_Multi-anntena_SA_MG.m```.
To run the programs in this folder, the following packages need to be installed:

* **matlab2tikz** (for exporting figures to Overleaf)
* **Optimization Toolbox** (for optimization tasks)
* **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox**
* **Symbolic Math Toolbox**

From the MATLAB top menu, go to the "Home" tab, click on "Add-Ons", and select "Get Add-Ons".
Then, search for the desired package in the search bar and install it.
